  - [x] Implement methods for creating, fetching, updating, and deleting orders.
  - [x] Ensure transaction handling for the deletion of orders to also delete related `order_items`
- [x] **Order Items Model**: Develop a model to represent the items within an order. 
  - [x] This model should include attributes such as `order_item_id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, and `price`.
  - [x] Implement methods for fetching and creating order items.
- [x] **API Endpoints**
  - [x] **Product Endpoints**:
    - [x] `GET /products`: Fetch a list of all products.
    - [x] `GET /products/:id`: Fetch details of a specific product by its ID.
    - [x] `POST /products`: Add a new product to the database.
    - [x] `PUT /products/:id`: Update the details of an existing product.
    - [x] `DELETE /products/:id`: Remove a product from the database.
  - [x] **Order Endpoints**:
    - [x] `GET /orders`: Fetch a list of all orders.
    - [x] `GET /orders/:order_id`: Fetch details of a specific order by its ID, including the order items.
    - [x] `POST /orders`: Create a new order with order items.
    - [x] `PUT /orders/:order_id`: Update the details of an existing order (e.g., change status).
    - [x] `DELETE /orders/:order_id`: Remove an order from the database.
- [x] **Frontend Integration**
  - [x] Connect the backend API to the provided frontend interface, ensuring dynamic interaction for product browsing, cart management, and order placement. Adjust the frontend as necessary to work with your API.


#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [x] **Added Endpoints**
  - [x] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database.
  - [x] Create an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its ID.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt like the labs and lectures prepared me thoroughly to create the API endpoints. However, when it came to connecting the backend with the frontend I got a bit confused as the instructions for doing so weren't listed on the project instructions. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would work on additional stretch features specifically the one where I can create my own frontend.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I felt more confident this time around when presenting my project. I practiced ahead of time which contributed greatly to my confidence level.
